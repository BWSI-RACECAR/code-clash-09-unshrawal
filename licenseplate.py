Author: Wonjun Lee

Difficulty Level: 5/10

Prompt: Jon was speeding on the highway with his RACECAR, and the highway camera has taken a picture 
of the RACECAR’s number plate. However, some characters on the plate are blurry. Please write a function 
that returns the number of possible combinations of the number plate. The number plate for his RACECAR
consists of 7 distinct characters, starting with 3 distinct alphabets and ending with 4 distinct numbers. 
The input will be passed as a string and any blurred characters will be written as ‘.’

Test Cases: 
Input: “ABC123.” ; Output: 7
Input: “.ON0123” ; Output: 24
Input: “.BC.234” ; Output: 168
